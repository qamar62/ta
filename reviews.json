        "content": "We are using the services of Arabian Nights for our guest and family members since more than a decade. We used them again for our close family members this month, From start to finish, our experience with Arabian Nights was outstanding. The booking process was seamless, and Rose, our point of contact, was incredibly helpful and professional, ensuring all our questions were answered promptly. Our tour captain and driver, Hamdan, went above and beyond to make our trip memorable. From the moment he picked us up, his friendly demeanor and expertise put us at ease.Hamdan facilitated an exciting ATV adventure and took us to a stunning sunset viewpoint, which provided breathtaking photo opportunities. He also gave us an adrenaline-filled drift experience that thrilled our group, which included 3 teens and 4 adults. Every moment was well-paced, and we all had an amazing time.The desert camp was impeccably clean and well-organized. The evening entertainment, including the belly dance and fire show, was captivating, and the food served was both delicious and plentiful. This tour perfectly combined adventure, comfort and cultural immersion, making it a truly unforgettable experience for our family. Highly recommended!",

Our tour leader was really nice and considerate as one person in our group didn\u2019t feel good enough to continue on the big rides on the huge sand dunes! The views were amazing we took some amazing pictures! Afterwards we had some really good BBQ and the shows  were awesome!- it really was the highlight of our vacation!",

        "content": "This is a bad operator. I\u2019ve seen a lot of Arabian nights tours and this was not a good option out of all of them. Our car was the oldest and worst condition for our 1+ hour drive there and back with our driver being on his phone texting the entire time swerving into other lanes.Our first stop was at a marketplace to buy hajibs which is fine but our second stop was the ATV Park which we did not sign up for & he continued to try to upsell us on. After wasting way too much time at the atv park we stopped at a gas station- fine.Then we drove around the sand dunes which was fun but painful considering the cars condition (2003 model). Then he stopped to put air in his tires - fine. Then he stopped to talk to his buddies in a parking lot. By the time we arrived at the night camp we were the last ones. We missed the fresh bread, henna tattoo, roti wraps, tea, sand duning etc  because we were so late. I also thought everything would be done in the desert but you really only spend about 20-30 mins on the actual desert then you go back on the highway & go to this camp site off the highway. My pictures with the two poor camels had 8 Toyota camerys I\u2019m the background. Not authentic desert experience I was looking for. The cherry on top was our driver got stuck in the sand then stopped by two of his friends cars after we were unstuck to chat. Then went by two gas stations before finally dropping us off at 10:30pm when eta was supposed to be 9pm latest. Horrible don\u2019t recommend this operator",

        "content": "We did the tour as a last minute and thought we weren\u2019t going to get a place. But they were happy to fix us up a spot which is not very common in some tours. Our driver Ramzan was very knowledgeable of the area, punctual, and very kind to us. Make sure you eat a light meal beforehand as the dune bashing can be a bit tight on the stomach. There were some local people getting stuck in the dunes - but Ramzan  is very experienced and made sure we got out very smoothly. I\u2019d recommend him as a driver for future reference. Good food, good culture, good weather. 5+",
